In this project, our objective is to develop models to classify images of dogs and cats. We investigated several classification algorithms to train classifiers that accurately classify new unknown images as either “dogs” or “cats”, and then examined their performance.

The data comes from the world’s largest site that finds homes for homeless pets, and the images are now classified manually by people. By developing classification models, we hope to distinguish the images automatically by computer, so that the huge amount of images of dogs and cats can be classified more efficiently. This will speed up the process for distributing the images of dogs and cats to individuals who are willing to adopt dogs and cats, respectively. Precise advertising may increase the probability that the homeless pets successfully find their new owners.
